# CPUSchedulingAlgoVisual
This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that visualizes various CPU scheduling algorithms. The visualizer supports popular algorithms such as FCFS, SJN, PS and RR Users can input different processes, adjust their parameters, and see how the scheduler handles them in real-time through intuitive graphical representations.
